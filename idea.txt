I was watching a youtube instructional video and I spotify to get quiter so I could hear the video, and for it to get louder whenvever I pause it
todo:
-tell when any chrome tab is playing audio (or just when crome does?)
--extend this to any application?
-change the volume levels of specific applications
-have a defualt (lower) volume for spotify to change depending on what application is playing audio


revision_1:
-tell which applications are playing audio and which aren't
-set priorities for specific applications
--default priority set to highest so nothing changes
-lower volue of lower priority applications whenever a higher priority application is using audio


progress:
-have a bit of python code to change windows audio
--//need to test it//
--it works!!1
5/29
-found a library (pycaw) that will let me do exactly what I want to do without first setting the volume to 100%
--setting up a priority systemm
--want to have a separate python file just to check if spotify is running and playing music
---would be cool if it didn't run when spotify wasn't playing music

6/28
-code detects when chrome is running and lowers the volume of spotify
